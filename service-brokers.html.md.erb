* The [Supporting Multiple <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Instances](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/supporting-multiple-cf-instances.html) topic has information about registering a service broker with multiple <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) instances.


## <a id="route"></a> Route Services Resources

* [Route Services](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/route-services.html) explains how route services work, and what are the different architectures for using them in a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
