This topic describes the changes in <%= vars.platform_name %> v2.10 that might be relevant to partner service tiles.

For information about changes introduced in Ops Manager v2.10,
see [Ops Manager v2.10 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html).

## <a id="features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release that may affect tile development for partners:

### <a id="log-format-change"></a> Timestamp Format Change and Customizable <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Component Logs

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.10, operators can modify the timestamp format of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component logs.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.10 removes the `diego_log_timestamp_format` tile property and replaces 
it with the `logging_timestamp_format` property, which allows operators to configure human-readable timestamps across <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components. Most, but not all, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components can support the RFC3339 timestamp format.

For a list of components that use the RFC3339 timestamp format in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.10 , see [Optionally Use Human-Readable Timestamps for Component Logs](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/release-notes/runtime-rn.html#timestamps) in the _VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs v2.10 Release Notes_. 

This feature may affect any partner tiles that parse or consume <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component logs. 

For more information, see [Timestamp Format for Component Logs Replaces Timestamp Format for Diego Logs](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/release-notes/breaking-changes.html#timestamps).

### <a id="credhub-maestro-support"></a> Support for CredHub Maestro and Bulk Rotation of Certificates 

In Ops Manager v2.9 and later, operators can perform a bulk rotation of all CAs and certificates in a foundation, which may include leaf certificates used by individual tiles. Ops Manager invokes CredHub Maestro to perform the bulk rotation of certificates. 

To ensure compatibility with CredHub Maestro, your tile must use a specific format when referencing CAs. CredHub Maestro requires that triple parentheses references to any CAs that sign leaf certificates return a concatenated version of the CA. The concatenated version, which includes the older and newer CA, ensures that jobs using leaf certificates do not lose trusted state during CA rotation. This translates to the least amount of downtime for your tile's services during certificate rotation.

For more information and examples, see [Reference Existing CAs and Certificates in CredHub Variables](.
